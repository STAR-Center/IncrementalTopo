# Incremental-Topo

**Yuan, Y. & Schwertfeger, S.** (2019). Incrementally Building Topology Graphs via Distance Maps. In 2019 IEEE International Conference on Real-time Computing and Robotics (RCAR). IEEE. 

This is our project folder for ***Incrementally Building Topology Graphs via Distance Maps***. More detail and bibtex will be available later.

### How to use it:

#### For distance map topomap:
```
python run.py#note that you need to change the path to ./test_im/xxx/clean.png
```

#### For incremental topomap:
```
python ITOPO_offline.py #used the provided rosbag in ./bag
```
